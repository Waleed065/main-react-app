            whether via a Link Micro-Site or Connection. As such, it shall not
            sell, use, disclose or disseminate the Vurtos.com Material (whether

            <br />

            relationship include: i. anything that may cause Vurtos.com to be
            excluded from the process of booking; ii. speaking negatively or
            detrimentally about Vurtos.com with regard to Accommodations; iii.
            doing anything that may cause an Accommodation to terminate its
            contract or reduce its dealings and business with Vurtos.com; iv.
            communicating directly with any Accommodations in respect of
            bookings made through the System; and v. making bookings or
            reservations through the System with the purpose of reselling to or
            for the benefit of a third party. (c) The Affiliate shall diligently
            maintain the content of the Affiliate Website(s) and shall keep the
            Affiliate Website(s) up-to-date and accurate. The Affiliate shall

            after becoming aware of such errors or being notified by Vurtos.com.
            (d) The Affiliate shall not programmatically evaluate and extract
            information (including guest reviews) from any part of the
            Vurtos.com Platform (including, but not limited to screen scraping).
            (e) Affiliate agrees and acknowledges that the restrictive
            covenants, undertakings, and restrictions set out in this clause 4
            are of material importance to Vurtos.com, in particular for the
            protection of: i. Vurtos.com’s goodwill; ii. Vurtos.com Intellectual
            Property Rights; and iii. Vurtos.com’s product, service and
            reputation. (f) Furthermore, the Affiliate agrees and acknowledges
            that all covenants, undertakings, and restrictions set out in this
            clause 4 shall: i. be promptly, and diligently complied with; and
            ii. also apply in respect of the companies within the Affiliate
            Group . (g) Parties agree and acknowledge that in the event of an
            (alleged or threatening) infringement or breach by the Affiliate of
            its obligations under this clause 4 the burden of proof is carried
            by the Affiliate. 4.2 Goodwill and brand protection (a) The
            Affiliate undertakes that the Affiliate Website(s) (including all
            other websites, apps, platforms, tools or other devices (directly or
            indirectly)) is owned, controlled, managed or hosted by the
            Affiliate, in particular in respect of: i. the look and feel in
            respect of the colour scheme, the composition, the typefaces, the
            design and the layout; and ii. any logo(s) used on the Affiliate
            Website(s) (including those within the Affiliate Group); and that
            features and elements that are unique to the Vurtos.com Platform,
            is/are (and shall remain) sufficiently and substantially distinct
            from the Vurtos.com Platform(s) (to be determined by Vurtos.com at
            its sole discretion). (b) The Affiliate shall promptly comply at its
            own costs with any reasonable requests from Vurtos.com to make
            changes, alterations or amendments to any aspect or element of the
            Affiliate Website(s) which is or can be regarded to be confusingly
            or significantly similar to any element of the Vurtos.com Platform.
            4.3 Intellectual Property Rights (a) The Affiliate acknowledges that
            Vurtos.com and/or its licensors shall retain ownership of all
            rights, title and interest in and to all Intellectual Property
            Rights of Vurtos.com or those embodied in the Vurtos.com Platform
            (including the Content). (b) The Affiliate shall not (directly or
            indirectly) integrate, combine or otherwise make the Vurtos.com
            Material (or any part thereof) available with its own content and/or
            the content of any Vurtos.com Competitor. (c) The Affiliate shall
            not amend, alter, modify, or create derivative works based on or
            derived from the Vurtos.com Material. Vurtos.com Material shall only
            be used to enable the Service. (d) Upon termination or expiration of
            this Agreement, the Affiliate shall destroy, delete or upon first
            request of Vurtos.com return all Vurtos.com Material (including all
            hard and soft copies). (e) The Affiliate shall (and shall procure
            that the companies within the Affiliate Group shall) not (directly
            or indirectly) register, acquire or obtain Internet domain name(s)
            which incorporates any word or words which are identical, or
            confusingly or substantially similar to "Booking", "Bookings" or any
            variations, translations or misspellings thereof, included as part
            of the address. (f) By entering into this Agreement, Vurtos.com does
            not (explicitly or tacitly) waive or forfeit any of its rights to
            which it is entitled by any law, contract or otherwise (now or in
            the future) in respect of the Vurtos.com Intellectual Property
            Rights vis-à-vis the Affiliate or other third parties. 4.4 Promotion
            and marketing (a) The Affiliate shall not use, exploit or otherwise
            employ, directly or indirectly, any Third Party Platforms, to seek
            to avoid or circumvent its covenants, obligations or restrictions
            under this Agreement. The Affiliate shall avoid all forms of
            trickery when promoting and marketing the Affiliate Websites. If the
            Affiliate is perceived to be jeopardising Vurtos.com’s own position,
            brand or goodwill in/on Third Party Platform or elsewhere, through
            any underhand promotional or marketing techniques, the Affiliate
            shall upon first request of Vurtos.com cease and desist such
            activities. (b) In the event that Vurtos.com (Platform) is
            detrimentally linked to promotional or marketing activity by the
            Affiliate (Website(s)), the Affiliate agrees to promptly comply with
            the reasonable requests of Vurtos.com to remedy. The Affiliate shall
            promptly contact each Third Party Platform or third party agency,
            and revise the Affiliate Website(s) and all ad copy, titles,
            descriptions, keywords, URL’s, text links, advertisements, including
            all meta tags (meta titles, meta keywords and meta descriptions) to
            comply with the terms of this Agreement or as requested by
            Vurtos.com. During any remedial period Vurtos.com shall be entitled
            to postpone its obligations under this Agreement (including the
            offer of the Service, System and the Vurtos.com Material) or
            immediately terminate this Agreement. 4.5 No Double Serving (a) The
            Affiliate shall not (directly or indirectly) use or create any
            (pay-per-click) advertisement on (meta)search sites, which
            advertisement (re)directs and links to the relevant Accommodation
            landing page, on the Websites where the Accommodation is advertised,
            promoted and/or included (no double serving). The Affiliate shall be
            entitled to bid on or use the Vurtos.com brand for its own
            webmarketing (PPC) advertising. 4.6 Price Comparison (a) In the
            event that the Affiliate offers price comparison on a relevant
            Affiliate Website(s), the Affiliate shall solely be granted access
            to the rate(s) and availability data of relevant Accommodations
            (collectively, the "Rates and Availability Data") via a direct
            connection to the Vurtos.com web-servers (i.e. via a XML). The Rates
            and Availability Data will be made available in accordance with the
            terms and conditions of the API Guidelines, which will be mutually
            concluded between the parties if the Rates and Availability Data
            will be made available. The API Guidelines shall form an integral
            part of this Agreement and must be read in conjunction with this
            Agreement. No Vurtos.com Material is to be used, copied or referred
            to. (b) When offering price comparison, the room rates must be
            compared fairly and with equal favour, in terms of ranking, to all
            Vurtos.com Competitors. Rates made available by Vurtos.com
            Competitors must be accurate, correct and not misleading (at least
            match the relevant prices made available on the websites, apps,
            platform, tools or other devices of the Vurtos.com Competitors) and
            comply with the relevant applicable laws.

            <br />
            5. COMMISSION AND PAYMENT 5.1 Except as otherwise provided in this
            Agreement, Vurtos.com will pay the Affiliate a Commission for each
            Materialised Transaction in accordance with the following
            provisions. 5.2 The following Commercial Model will be applied to
            all reservations created during the term of this Agreement:
            Materialised Transactions per month Percentage Commission Split 0-50
            25% more than 50 30% more than 150 35% more than 500 40% 5.3 The
            Commission for each Materialised Transaction will be calculated over
            the Transaction Fee by using a Percentage Commission Split in line
            with the Commercial Model in clause 5.2 herein The applicable tier
            of the Commercial Model will be determined based on the number of
            Materialised Transactions in the month that is due for payment on
            the Invoice (as defined herein). 5.4 Vurtos.com reserves the right
            to unilaterally amend the Commission Model included as per clause
            5.2 herein upon written notice thereof to the Affiliate. Affiliate
            is deemed to have accepted the amended Commission Model upon
            continued use of the Services. Alternatively, the Affiliate may
            terminate the Agreement upon written notice to Vurtos.com with
            immediate effect. 5.5 In the event that any reservations have been
            wrongfully identified as Materialised Transaction(s), Vurtos.com is
            entitled to retroactively adjust the applicable tier for all
            Materialised Transactions affected by such reservations and recoup
            any overpayments. 5.6 Vurtos.com and the Affiliate agree to apply
            the procedure of self-billing for all services provided by the
            Affiliate to Vurtos.com. The Affiliate expressly authorizes
            Vurtos.com to issue in its name and on its behalf, all invoices
            relating to the service provided under this Agreement in accordance
            with the requirements of the applicable law. If the Affiliate does
            not notify Vurtos.com within 3 business days after the invoice date
            that it does not agree with the issued invoice, the invoice is
            accepted by the Affiliate. 5.7 On or before the 5th business day of
            each month, Vurtos.com shall provide the Affiliate with an invoice
            stating the Commissions payable that month (the “Invoice”). 5.8
            Vurtos.com shall pay all Commission to the Affiliate on a monthly
            basis, up to 60 days after the end of the month in which the guest
            departs, unless the amount of Commissions due to the Affiliate at
            that time is less than €100 total, in which event Vurtos.com will be
            entitled to postpone payment until the month when such (accumulated)
            amount is due or until the amount is claimed by the Affiliate after
            the termination of this Agreement. Payments shall be made by bank
            transfer to such bank account or other payment method as from time
            to time identified by the Affiliate (provided that at all times
            Affiliate's use of such bank account/payment method complies with
            the provisions of clauses 12.6 and 12.7). 5.9 The systems, books,
            data and records of Vurtos.com (including Extranet, faxes and/or
            emails) shall be used to calculate, and considered conclusive
            evidence in respect of (the calculation of), the amount of the
            Commissions due to the Affiliate under this Agreement. 5.10 For any
            reservations for which there is no Transaction Fee, including but
            not limited to special negotiated or non-publicity rates (e.g.
            corporate rates), the Parties agree and acknowledge that such
            reservations shall not be subject to or included in the
            determination of the applicable tier nor the calculation of the
            Commission, nor be included in any other form of compensation paid
            by Vurtos.com to or for the benefit of the Affiliate under or
            pursuant to the Agreement. 5.11 Vurtos.com may, in its sole
            discretion, include in the calculation of the Commissions the fee
            owed to Vurtos.com for a Materialised Transaction, even if such fee
            has not yet been received by Vurtos.com, and therefore does not yet
            constitute a Transaction Fee (an "Unpaid Materialised Transaction").
            If Vurtos.com pays Affiliate for an Unpaid Materialised Transaction
            and does not later receive the Transaction Fee, or if the later
            Transaction Fee is lower than that paid projected fee (an “Incorrect
            Commission”), Vurtos.com is entitled to recoup the difference
            between the paid amount and the Transaction Fee, if any. Neither a
            payment, or pattern of payments, nor a lack of recoupment or pattern
            of lack of recoupments for Unpaid Materialised Transactions or
            Incorrect Commissions shall constitute a waiver of Vurtos.com’s
            rights herein. 5.12 Commission shall be exclusive of VAT. Where any
            service by Affiliate under this Agreement is or becomes subject to
            VAT and Affiliate is required to account for that VAT to a tax
            authority, then Vurtos.com shall pay the relevant VAT amount to
            Affiliate against delivery of a valid VAT invoice. The VAT treatment
            of any service by Affiliate under this Agreement shall be determined
            in accordance with the local VAT legislation in the relevant
            countries where such service is deemed to be made for VAT purposes.
            Adjustments to any amounts of the Commission payable under this
            Agreement shall also be calculated on a VAT-exclusive basis, and the
            party paying the adjustment shall pay any corresponding amount due
            in respect of VAT on paying the adjustment or, if later, promptly
            following receipt of a credit or debit note, as the case may be, in
            a form that is valid for VAT purposes. 5.13 For each reservation
            made on or through the Affiliate Website(s) (through the Service),
            the Affiliate shall be entitled to compensate and grant a cashback
            to the relevant Guest up to a maximum amount of 4% of total bookings
            value of the relevant Materialized Transaction.
            <br />
            <br />
            6. FRAUDULENT RESERVATIONS 6.1 Parties agree that when calculating
            the Commission due to the Affiliate, fraudulent reservations will
            not be taken into account as Materialised Transactions (each a
            “Fraudulent Reservation”). 6.2 Subject to clause 6.3 herein, in the
            event that Vurtos.com has been informed by the accommodation partner
            of an (alleged) Fraudulent Reservation or if it otherwise has reason
            to believe that the relevant reservation concerns a fraudulent
            reservation, Vurtos.com is entitled to recoup the Commission for
            such Fraudulent Reservation. 6.3 To the extent that the Affiliate
            has incurred costs in connection with a Fraudulent Reservation (i.e.
            issuance of any loyalty/membership points/rewards under its loyalty
            program to the relevant Guest who made a fraudulent reservation or
            shared commission with a sub-affiliate partner (if applicable)), the
            Affiliate shall reclaim the relevant paid/granted funds,
            rewards/points/etc. Insofar as the Affiliate (acting in good faith)
            cannot reasonably reclaim the relevant funds or rewards/points/etc.
            (e.g. points have been spent) or is legally not entitled to reclaim
            the relevant funds or rewards/points/etc., it shall be entitled to
            the relevant Commission for the Fraudulent Reservation. Parties
            shall in good faith discuss the situation to resolve the situation
            and fraudulent behaviour in an amicable manner.
            <br />
            <br />

            8. INDEMNIFICATION AND LIABILITY 8.1 Each Party (the "Indemnifying
            Party") shall be liable towards, and compensate, indemnify and hold

            provided for in this Agreement, the maximum liability of a Party for
            all claims made against such party by the other Party under or in
            connection with this Agreement in a year shall not exceed the
            aggregate commission received or paid by such Party in the preceding
            year or EUR 100,000 (whichever is higher), unless in the event of
            fraud or wilful misconduct of Indemnifying Party, in which event the
            limitation of liability is not applicable for such liable party. 8.3
            In the event of a third party claim, the indemnified Party shall
            promptly notify the other Party and Parties shall act in good faith
            and use their commercially reasonable efforts to consult, cooperate
            and assist each other in the defence and/or settlement of such
            claim, whereas the indemnifying Party shall be entitled to take over
            a claim and assume the defence and settlement (in consultation and
            agreement with the indemnified Party and with due observance of both
            Parties' interests), and neither Party shall make any admission,
            file any papers, consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into
            any compromise or settlement without the prior written consent of
            the other Party (which shall not unreasonably be withheld, delayed
            or conditioned). 8.4 In no event shall any Party be liable to the
            other Party for any loss of production, loss of profit, loss of
            revenue, loss of contract, loss of or damage to goodwill or
            reputation, loss of claim or any indirect, special, punitive,
            incidental or consequential damages or losses whether such damages
            are (alleged as) a result of a breach of contract, tort or
            otherwise. All such damages and losses are hereby expressly waived
            and disclaimed. 8.5 Notwithstanding contrary in this Agreement,
            Affiliate shall: (a) be fully responsible and liable for any
            infringement of applicable data protection, ePrivacy or marketing
            laws, legislation, regulations or codes when promoting the Services
            as permitted under the Agreement; and (b) shall fully indemnify
            Vurtos.com for any damages, losses, claims, costs and fines suffered
            by or imposed on Vurtos.com as a result of a breach of this clause

            9. TERM, TERMINATION AND SUSPENSION 9.1 Unless agreed otherwise,
            this Agreement shall commence on the date hereof for an indefinite
            period of time. 9.2 Each Party may terminate this Agreement with
            immediate effect at any time and for any reason, by written or email
            notice to the other Party. 9.3 Each Party may terminate this
            Agreement or suspend this Agreement in respect of the other Party,
            with immediate effect and without a notice of default being required
            in case of: (a) a material breach by the other Party of any term of
            this Agreement; (b) (filing of a request for) bankruptcy or
            suspension of payment (or similar action) in respect of the other
            Party; or (c) a (direct or indirect) change of Control in respect of
            the other Party. 9.4 This Agreement will terminate automatically in
            the case that no Materialized Transactions are effected in a period

            Commission in accordance with Article 5 above for a period of 12

            has the correct contact and banking details for the Affiliate during
            that period. Should the Affiliate fail to claim any unpaid
            Commission within that 12 month period, such failure shall
            constitute an effective waiver of the Affiliate’s right to claim
            such Commission. 9.6 In the event of a breach of clause 4 herein by
            or attributable to the Affiliate, Vurtos.com shall be entitled to

            suspension of its (payment) obligations under or termination of this
            Agreement with immediate effect and without prejudice to the rights
            that have already accrued prior to the breach; and/or (b) Vurtos.com
            shall be entitled to use a Percentage Commission Split of 0% for all
            bookings made and/or each Materialised Transaction during the term
            that the Affiliate breaches the relevant obligations set out in
            clause 4 herein or has not remedied its breach of the relevant
            obligations as set out in clause 4 herein in full. 9.7 Upon
            termination and save as set out otherwise, this Agreement shall
            absolutely and entirely terminate and cease to have effect without
            prejudice to Party’s rights and remedies in respect of an
            indemnification or a breach by the other party of this Agreement.
            Termination shall not affect any provision of this Agreement which
            is expressly or by implication intended to come into effect on, or
            to continue in effect after, such termination or expiry, including,
            but not limited to, clauses 4.1(a), 4.1(b), 4.1(d), 4.1(e), 4.2,
            4.3, 4.4(b), 7.3, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14.

            fraudulent evasion of any tax, or (ii) otherwise breach or take any
            action that may place the other Party in breach of applicable laws
            prohibiting tax evasion and the facilitation thereof. 12.3 Each
            Party represents and warrants that, for the term of this Agreement,
            it is not (i) listed on any applicable list of sanctioned parties

            fully in compliance with all applicable laws (including, without

            actual or suspected breach of this clause 12 by the Affiliate or its

            therefore, terminates the Agreement. 13.6 Parties agree that
            Vurtos.com retains the right to unilaterally amend the form in which
            the Services are made available, or any applicable terms or

            with a prior written notice thereof (which, for the avoidance of
            doubt, includes notification via email). The Affiliate is deemed to
            have accepted the amended Service model through continuing use of
            the Service, unless the Affiliates notifies Vurtos.com in writing

            provision of this Agreement is or becomes invalid or non-binding,

            that event, the Parties shall replace the invalid or non-binding
            provision by provisions that are valid and binding and that have, to
            the greatest extent possible, a similar effect as the invalid or
            non-binding provision, given the contents and purpose of this
            Agreement. 13.9 Affiliate agrees to comply and have individuals
